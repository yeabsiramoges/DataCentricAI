Subject Line: Put your algebraic geometry in “infinite geometric order!"

Hi Math Club Members!

Are you ready to take your math skills to a whole new level? Well, our upcoming Lunch & Learn about Algebraic Geometry will get you doing just that!

We’ll be exploring the fascinating world of two- and three-dimensional shapes, then using algebra to develop dazzling theories and problem-solving techniques. And don’t forget the exciting projects and challenges sitting at the intersection of mathematics, engineering, and art. What’s not to love?

So come out of your shell and join us to learn the ins and outs of algebraic geometry. You may not be as good as a Tortoise, but it’s sure to be an enjoyable experience that’ll have your mind in “infinite geometric order”!

See you at the meeting!

Dear Math Club Members,

Are you ready to have your minds blown by math? On March 14th, let’s celebrate the marvelous mathematical number that is pi! Come join us for an evening of fun, friends, food, and of course – PIE!

We’ll be testing our knowledge of pi’s digits with some fun trivia, playing some roll and shout pi, and finishing the night off with a pie eating contest. Who can eat the most pie in 3.14159 seconds?

Don’t forget to wear your best pi inspired outfits as we will be having a special fashion show and awarding prizes for the best dressed.

So, come on over to Pie-land and join us for this fantastic evening of math madness!

Sincerely,

The Math Club


Aloha, Mathletes!

Hopefully you’ve been brushing up on your equations and thinking outside the box, because the upcoming competition in Hawaii is going to be intense!

I know it must seem far away right now, but I’m sure you’re all counting down the days until you get to unleash your math skills in the islands.

But if your schoolmates are giving you a hard time about joining the math club, just remind them that you’re off to the Paradise of Pi and they’ll be left behind! That should get them off your back.

So get packing and let’s show Hawaii who’s got the best math skills around!

Mahalo,

Math Club President
