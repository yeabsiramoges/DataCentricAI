Dear Running Club, 

It has been an incredibly hot and exhausting race season so far, but it was worth it for the great results we’ve achieved! Congrats to everyone for pushing through the heat and perspiring all the way to the finish line. Our team has definitely shown grit and determination in spite of all the sweat and tears! 

To celebrate this great feat, we’re treating the team to a cold treat! Each runner will receive a complimentary Popsicle with our team mascot on it to mark the success of powering through the race and staying cool under pressure. All of your hard work has certainly paid off!

Here’s to a winning season!

Dear Running Club,

It's time to lace up those shoes and get ready for a race like no other! 

So shut out the noise and stay focused on your goals,
Trust the process and reach that finish line with a smile on your soul,
The pain will not last but alive will the fire,
As we cross that finish line with hearts full of drive!

Now fuel up your bodies, stretch those muscles, and get ready for the grand finale! Let's show the competition who are the real champions!

Run through the miles,
Endless with heart and spirit too,
Victory awaits!

Dear Running Club,

It's that time again! It's time to elect a new team captain for the semester. As you all know, it's an important decision, so don't take it too lightly!

Candidates, bring your A-game: give us your most heart-warming stories and a dazzling pair of hard-worn shoes (there's no costume contest this time - sorry!).

But most of all, let's enjoy the process. Let the voting commence and may the best candidate win!
