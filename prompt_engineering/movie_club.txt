Dear Movie Club Members,

We hope you are all excited for the upcoming Harry Potter themed formal social! Put on your robes, practice your spells and make sure your wands are polished and ready to go. We'll have a sorting hat ceremony to determine which house you'll be in for the evening - Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, or Ravenclaw. Grab your friends and have a cauldronful of fun at this magical event!

But before you get ready to fly off to Hogwarts, there's something else you'll need to take with you - your sense of humor! After all, what kind of a Harry Potter themed party would it be without some magical wit and hilarity?

We ask that you leave your Muggles at the door and put your wit to the test by making your fellow movie club members laugh with your most clever jinxes and funniest spells. But don't worry if you're not a born spell master - wit and humor know no bounds. 

So gear up for a night of enchantment, excitement and unwavering wit. Just remember - be nice to your fellow house members - no spells to be used on each other
